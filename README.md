ChatGPT Chrome Extension Documentation
 Introduction
Understanding the functionalities of the ChatGPT Chrome extension and the accompanying mock API.
 Project Overview
The ChatGPT Chrome Extension is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for users to ask questions and receive responses powered by both a mock API and the real ChatGPT API. The extension features a popup that displays a text input field for entering questions and an area to display responses. The extension integrates seamlessly with a mock API for predefined responses and also connects to the ChatGPT API for more diverse answers.

Follow these steps to set up and run the ChatGPT Chrome Extension along with the mock API :-
 Chrome Extension Setup:
1. Clone the repository or create a new folder for your Chrome extension project.
2. Create essential files: `manifest.json`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`, and `styles.css`.

   - `manifest.json`: Define extension details, permissions, and behavior.
   - `popup.html`: Design the user interface of the popup.
   - `popup.js`: Implement the logic for the popup.
   - `styles.css`: Define the styles for the popup.

3. Fill in the content of each file based on the provided guidance.
 Mock API Setup:
1. Create a new folder for your mock API server.
2. Install required packages using npm or yarn:

   npm install express

3. Create the mock API files: `server.js`.

4. Implement mock API logic, routes, and predefined responses.
 Running the Extension and Mock API:
1. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" and click "Load unpacked," selecting your extension folder.

2. Run the mock API server:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the mock API folder.
   - Run the command: `node server.js`.

 Features and Design
 UI/UX Enhancement
To improve the user experience, I made design choices that prioritize simplicity and clarity. The popup interface includes a minimalistic design with well-defined input and display areas. Styling elements were carefully chosen to ensure readability and a visually appealing layout.
 Error Handling and Retry Mechanism

A significant design decision was implementing an error handling and retry mechanism for the ChatGPT API requests. This feature was essential to handle potential API errors, such as rate limiting. The extension now retries failed requests with a brief delay, ensuring a smoother user experience and improved reliability.

 Challenges Faced
 Rate Limiting and Error Handling
One of the challenges I encountered was dealing with rate limiting from the ChatGPT API. When the API request limit was exceeded, the extension would receive errors and potentially disrupt user interactions. To address this, I had to implement a retry mechanism to ensure that failed requests were retried after a short delay.
 Balancing Responses from Mock and ChatGPT API

Another challenge was managing the balance between responses from the mock API and the ChatGPT API. I wanted mock questions to trigger predefined responses while allowing other questions to be answered by ChatGPT. This required careful conditional logic and routing to the appropriate API based on the question type.

 Overcoming Challenges
 Retry Mechanism Implementation

To overcome rate limiting issues, I implemented a retry mechanism using asynchronous programming. Whenever the ChatGPT API request failed, the extension would wait for a brief interval before attempting the request again. This solution improved the chances of successful API interactions while minimizing disruptions for users.
 Conditional Routing and Response Handling

To ensure the correct API was used for different questions, I implemented conditional routing in the extension logic. Mock questions triggered responses from the mock API, while other questions were directed to the ChatGPT API. This approach allowed me to seamlessly integrate the two APIs while providing users with relevant answers.
 Conclusion

The ChatGPT Chrome Extension project was both a learning experience and an opportunity to develop practical skills. By addressing challenges such as rate limiting and designing an intuitive UI, I gained insights into API integration, error handling, and user-centric design.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey in developing this extension. I'm excited to have built a functional and user-friendly tool that demonstrates the power of integrating APIs for engaging user interactions.
